# Minimum-Cash-Flow
An expense-sharing Java swing application that minimizes the cash flow among a given set of users who have borrowed money from each other.
Simplify debts (a.k.a. “debt simplification”) is a feature of Splitwise that restructures debt within groups of people. It does not change the total amount that anyone owes, but it makes it easier to pay people back by minimizing the total number of payments.
## Problem Statement
Given a number of friends who have to give or take some amount of money from one another. Design an algorithm by which the total cash flow among all the friends is minimized.
